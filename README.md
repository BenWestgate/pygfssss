# Overview

`pygfssss` is a Python 3 implementation of [Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing),
using polynomials over GF(256).

Shamir's Secret Sharing can be used to split a secret into multiple shares. A specified threshold amount of
shares can be used to reconstruct the original secret.

Having less than the threshold amount of shares doesn't provide any information on the secret (aside of
its size).

# Origins

`pygfssss` is heavily based on Mathias Herberts' PySSSS (https://github.com/hbs/PySSSS), extended with
the following features -
* Python 3 (only) support.
* Single X value used per share - for all bytes (instead of a different X value for every byte).
* Code simplified and clarified somewhat.
* Command line tool (`gfssss`) provided.
* Compatibility with [`gfshare`](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/focal/man7/gfshare.7.html) -
  using 0x11d prime polynomial, `gfsplit`/`gfcombine` command line tools provided.
* Unit tests coverage.

# Installation

`pygfssss` is provided as a standard Python package. It can be installed with standard Python tools.

For example, Linux installation in a virtualenv directly from GitHub -

```
python -m virtualenv venv
venv/bin/python -m pip install https://github.com/trianglee/pygfssss
```

`pygfssss` runs on Linux and Windows.

# `gfssss` Command Line Tool

`gfssss` can be used to split and combine.

To split secret.txt into 5 shares, where any 3 are needed to reconstruct -

```
cat secret.txt | venv/bin/gfssss split 3 5
```

(each output line is a different share).

To combine some of these shares back into the secret -

```
cat share1.txt share3.txt share5.txt | venv/bin/gfssss combine
```

(if an insufficient number of shares is provided, the output would be random).

# `gfshare` Compatibility

[gfshare](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/focal/man7/gfshare.7.html) is a de-facto standard of
Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme for Linux.

`pygfssss` provides the `gfsplit` and `gfcombine` command line tools which are compatible with
gfshare. Shares generated by `gfshare` can be combined using `pygfssss` and vice versa.
